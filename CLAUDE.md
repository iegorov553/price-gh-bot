# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Run bot locally**: `python price_bot.py`
- **Deploy to Railway**: Automatically handled by `railway.json` config

## Architecture Overview

This is a single-file Telegram bot (`price_bot.py`) that scrapes prices from eBay and Grailed listings, adds US shipping costs, applies tiered commission structure, and converts to RUB. The bot operates in two modes:
- **Webhook mode**: When deployed with a public domain (Railway), uses webhooks for production
- **Polling mode**: Falls back to long-polling when no public domain is available (local development)

### Core Components

- **Price scrapers**: Combined function `get_price_and_shipping()` that extracts both item price and US shipping cost from eBay and Grailed listings
- **Shipping scrapers**: Separate functions for eBay (`scrape_shipping_ebay`) and Grailed (`scrape_shipping_grailed`) that parse shipping costs
- **Link resolution**: Handles Grailed app.link shorteners by following redirects
- **Concurrent processing**: Uses `asyncio.gather()` to scrape multiple URLs in parallel when multiple links are detected
- **HTTP session**: Configured with retries and proper user agent for reliable scraping
- **Currency conversion**: Function `get_usd_to_rub_rate()` fetches USD to RUB exchange rate from Central Bank of Russia XML API with 5% markup
- **Admin notifications**: Function `notify_admin()` sends Telegram alerts to admin (ID: 26917201) when CBR API fails
- **Tiered pricing logic**: 
  - Items < $150: Fixed $15 commission (`total_cost + 15`)
  - Items â‰¥ $150: 10% markup (`total_cost * 1.10`)

### Environment Variables

- `BOT_TOKEN`: Required Telegram bot token
- `PORT`: Server port (defaults to 8000)
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` or `RAILWAY_URL`: Used to determine webhook mode vs polling mode

### Currency Exchange Rate Source

The bot uses the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) official XML API as the **only** source for USD to RUB exchange rates:

- **Endpoint**: `https://www.cbr.ru/scripts/XML_daily.asp`
- **Format**: XML with daily official rates
- **Processing**: Parses XML using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, finds USD entry, applies 5% markup
- **Error handling**: No fallback sources - if CBR API is unavailable, currency conversion is disabled and admin is notified
- **Admin notifications**: Telegram message sent to admin (ID: 26917201) when CBR API fails

### Deployment

The bot is designed for Railway deployment with automatic webhook configuration. The `railway.json` specifies build and start commands.
