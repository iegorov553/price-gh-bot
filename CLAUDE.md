# Price GH Bot — Quick Reference

## Overview
Price GH Bot is a Telegram assistant that calculates the full cost of purchasing items from eBay and Grailed for delivery to Russia. The bot resolves marketplace links, evaluates seller advisories (low rating, no reviews, no buy-now price), and provides detailed pricing breakdowns covering commission, customs duty, and international shipping.
