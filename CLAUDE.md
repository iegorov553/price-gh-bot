## Web Scraping Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Always analyze target website structure before implementing scraping logic:

1. **Page Structure Analysis**: Before writing any scraping code, use WebFetch tool to analyze the actual HTML/JSON structure of target pages
2. **Multiple Pattern Support**: Implement multiple regex patterns and fallback strategies since websites frequently change their data formats
3. **Dynamic Content**: Modern sites (like Grailed) use React SPA with dynamic JSON loading - account for various data formats and field names
4. **Robust Extraction**: Use multiple extraction strategies:
   - JSON parsing with various field name patterns
   - HTML element parsing as fallback
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
5. **Pattern Evolution**: Websites evolve - implement flexible patterns that can handle format changes without breaking

### Grailed.com Specific Knowledge (Critical)

**UPDATED June 2025**: Grailed now uses Next.js architecture with dual parsing strategies for listings and profiles.

#### Modern Grailed Architecture (Next.js)

**Listing Pages**: Now use Next.js with data embedded in `__NEXT_DATA__` script tags
- **Primary extraction method**: Parse JSON from `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">` 
- **Data location**: `props.pageProps.listing` contains all listing information
- **Available data**: price, title, shipping costs, seller info, buyability status
- **Fallback strategy**: Legacy HTML parsing for older listings

**Seller Profile Pages**: Still use React SPA requiring headless browser
- **Dynamic loading**: Seller data loaded via authenticated APIs after page render
- **Headless browser required**: Only method to extract rating, reviews, trusted badge
- **Static HTML limitation**: Profile data not available in initial HTML response

#### Profile Pages Limitations
- **Profile pages** (e.g., `grailed.com/username`) use **client-side rendering**
- Seller data (rating, reviews, trusted badge) is **NOT available in static HTML**
- Data is loaded dynamically via API calls after page load requiring authentication
- Profile pages return ~200KB of HTML but contain minimal actual content
- The HTML contains React root elements (`<div id="app">`) but no seller metrics
- **DO NOT** expect to extract seller data from profile pages without headless browser

#### What Works vs What Doesn't (Updated June 2025)

‚úÖ **Listing Pages (Next.js + HTTP requests)**:
- **Complete item data**: price, title, shipping costs, buyability status
- **Accurate extraction**: Real-time data from `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON
- **Seller profile URLs**: Extracted for further analysis
- **Performance**: Fast HTTP-only parsing (~2-3 seconds)
- **Compatibility**: Works with both modern Next.js and legacy HTML listings

‚ùå **Profile Pages (Require headless browser)**:
- **Seller ratings**: Only available via headless browser JavaScript execution
- **Review counts**: Dynamic loading after page render
- **Trusted badges**: Client-side verification
- **Activity timestamps**: Requires scrolling and dynamic content loading
- **Performance cost**: ~8-10 seconds per profile analysis

#### API Endpoints Discovery (May 2025)
- `grailed.com/api/users/{username}` exists but requires authentication (401)
- Access tokens found in HTML are for analytics/tracking, not user data access
- GraphQL endpoint `/graphql` returns 404
- No public API for seller profile data

#### Recommended Approach
1. **For seller analysis**: Focus on data extraction from **listing pages**, not profile pages
2. **Profile URLs**: Use for navigation/identification only, not data extraction  
3. **Fallback handling**: Always implement graceful degradation when seller data unavailable
4. **User communication**: Clearly explain limitations to users when profile analysis fails
5. **Alternative strategy**: Suggest users share specific listing URLs for seller analysis

#### Technical Implementation Notes (Updated June 2025)

**Listing Parsing (HTTP-based)**:
- **Next.js priority**: `_parse_next_data()` extracts from `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">`
- **Data structure**: `props.pageProps.listing` contains complete item information
- **Enhanced headers**: Browser-like headers prevent bot detection and JSON config responses
- **Legacy fallback**: Maintains compatibility with older listing formats
- **Error handling**: Content-Type validation prevents parsing JSON config as HTML

**Profile Parsing (Headless browser)**:
- **JavaScript execution**: Required for dynamic content loading
- **Scrolling mechanism**: Loads activity data by scrolling to listings
- **Stealth features**: Anti-detection measures for stable extraction
- **Resource optimization**: Selective content loading for performance

#### Debugging History & Lessons Learned (May 2025)
**Investigation conducted**: Exhaustive analysis of Grailed profile page structure including:
- WebFetch analysis of profile URLs
- Manual inspection of ~200KB HTML responses
- Script tag analysis for JSON data (found only category configuration data)
- API endpoint testing (discovered /api/users/{username} requires auth)
- Access token extraction and testing (tokens are for analytics, not user data)
- Multiple header combinations and user agent testing
- React root element inspection (confirmed SPA architecture)

**Key findings**:
- Profile pages return substantial HTML (~200KB) but it's mostly framework code
- No seller data exists in static HTML - all loaded post-render via authenticated APIs
- React app renders seller data client-side after page load
- `Thousandfacesstore` and `grailhunter` profiles confirmed to have zero extractable data in static content

**Attempted solutions that failed**:
- Enhanced regex patterns for seller data
- Deep JSON parsing of all script tags
- API endpoint discovery and token-based authentication
- Multiple user agent and header combinations

**Working solution implemented**:
- Enhanced `analyze_seller_profile()` with comprehensive search patterns
- Graceful degradation to "No Data" category when extraction fails
- Clear user communication about technical limitations
- Focus redirected to listing page data extraction where seller info is available

**Headless Browser Implementation (June 2025) - OPTIMIZED SOLUTION**:
- **Playwright integration** implemented as the ONLY working method for seller data extraction
- **Static HTML methods removed**: All JSON parsing, regex patterns, and script extraction methods removed as they don't work with React SPA
- **Dynamic content handling**: Headless browser waits for JavaScript execution and DOM manipulation to load seller data
- **Activity timestamp extraction**: Parses "X days/weeks/months ago" text patterns from seller profile pages after scrolling to load listings
- **Resource management**: Proper browser lifecycle with async context managers
- **Performance optimization**: Optimized for speed while maintaining human-like behavior to avoid bot detection
- **Configuration**: Can be disabled via `ENABLE_HEADLESS_BROWSER=false` environment variable
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to "No Data" category when headless browser disabled or fails

**Performance Optimizations (June 2025)**:
- **Speed improvements**: Reduced execution time from ~20 seconds to ~8-10 seconds (2.3x faster)
- **Human-like behavior**: Balanced speed with bot detection avoidance
- **Resource blocking**: Intelligent blocking of heavy media while keeping essential CSS/JS
- **Browser reuse**: Global browser instance for repeated requests (3-5 seconds for subsequent calls)
- **Stealth features**: Hidden automation markers and realistic browser behavior
- **Random delays**: Human-like timing patterns to avoid detection

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Single extraction method**: `app/scrapers/grailed.py` now uses only headless browser via `get_grailed_seller_data_headless()`
- **Selector strategy**: Multiple CSS selectors and text patterns to find rating, reviews, and trusted badge
- **Activity extraction**: Scrolls profile page to load listings, then extracts first "X time ago" pattern for accurate last activity timestamp
- **Time conversion**: Converts relative time expressions ("5 days ago") to absolute timestamps for reliability scoring
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback to "No Data" category
- **Dependencies**: Requires `playwright` and `playwright install chromium`

**Performance Notes**:
- Headless browser adds ~20 seconds per profile analysis
- Successfully extracts data that is impossible to get via static HTML
- Accurate activity timestamps enable proper reliability scoring (was giving all sellers 30/30 points)
- Essential for accurate seller reliability analysis on Grailed
- Scrolling mechanism ensures dynamic listing content loads before extraction
- Resource-efficient with proper browser lifecycle management

**Activity Extraction Breakthrough (May 2025)**:
- **Problem solved**: Replaced hardcoded "current time" with actual seller activity extraction
- **Method**: Parse listing update text ("5 days ago", "2 months ago") from seller profile pages
- **Implementation**: Scroll page to load dynamic listings, extract first time pattern with regex
- **Validation**: Tested with DP1211 seller - correctly shows 5 days since last activity
- **Impact**: Enables accurate activity scoring in reliability system (was previously giving all sellers maximum 30/30 activity points)

#### User Interface and Experience
- **Listing analysis**: Seller reliability shown for buyable Grailed items when data available
- **Direct profile analysis**: Full seller reliability analysis using headless browser extraction
- **Loading indicators**: Immediate feedback with "‚è≥ –ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∂–∞–µ–º –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥–∏–º —Ä–∞—Å—á—ë—Ç..." messages
- **Clean UX**: Loading messages automatically deleted when results are ready
- **Performance transparency**: Users see processing status during 8-10 second analysis time
- **Clean formatting**: Minimal emoji usage for better readability
- **Russian language**: All user messages in simple, neutral Russian with honest explanations of constraints
- **Enhanced error diagnostics**: Intelligent error handling with site availability checking
  - Automatic Grailed availability check when listing scraping fails
  - Context-aware error messages distinguishing between site downtime and listing issues
  - Response time monitoring for performance diagnostics
  - Three-tier error classification: site down, site slow, or listing-specific issues
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback to "No Data" category with clear explanations
- **Real-time updates**: Activity timestamps reflect actual seller behavior, not system time
- **Enhanced price display**: Structured multi-line format showing each cost component separately for better readability

**Lessons Learned (Updated June 2025)**:
- **Next.js architecture shift**: Grailed migrated listings to Next.js requiring new parsing strategies
- **Dual approach necessity**: Listings (HTTP + Next.js) vs Profiles (headless browser)
- **Data availability split**: Complete listing data in `__NEXT_DATA__`, seller data requires JS execution
- **Legacy compatibility**: Must maintain fallback parsing for older listing formats
- **Performance optimization**: HTTP parsing for listings (2-3s) vs headless for profiles (8-10s)
- **Bot detection evolved**: Enhanced headers prevent JSON config responses
- **Extraction accuracy**: Next.js parsing provides exact prices/shipping vs estimated defaults
- **Architecture adaptation**: Parser evolved from HTML-only to JSON-first with HTML fallback

## Architecture Overview

This Telegram bot uses a modular architecture with the following structure:
- **Entry point**: `app/main.py` - Application startup and configuration
- **Bot handlers**: `app/bot/handlers.py` - Message processing and URL handling  
- **Scrapers**: `app/scrapers/` - eBay and Grailed price/data extraction
- **Services**: `app/services/` - Currency, shipping, and reliability calculations
- **Models**: `app/models.py` - Pydantic data models for type safety
- **Configuration**: `app/config.py` - Settings and environment management
- **Messages**: `app/bot/messages.py` - Russian localized user messages

The bot scrapes prices from eBay and Grailed listings, adds US shipping costs, estimates Russia delivery costs via Shopfans Lite, applies tiered commission structure, converts to RUB, and provides comprehensive Grailed seller reliability analysis. It operates in two modes:
- **Webhook mode**: When deployed with a public domain (Railway), uses webhooks for production
- **Polling mode**: Falls back to long-polling when no public domain is available (local development)

### Core Components

- **Messages module**: `app/bot/messages.py` containing all user-facing text in Russian for easy localization and editing, with clean formatting and minimal emoji usage
- **Price scrapers**: Functions in `app/scrapers/` that extract item price, US shipping cost, buyability status, item title, and seller data from eBay and Grailed listings
- **Next.js parsing (June 2025)**: Grailed scraper prioritizes `__NEXT_DATA__` extraction for modern listings with fallback to legacy HTML parsing
- **Dual extraction strategy**: HTTP requests for listing data (fast), headless browser for seller profiles (comprehensive)
- **Buyability detection**: Grailed scraper analyzes JSON data to determine if items have fixed buy-now pricing or are offer-only
- **Seller analysis**: Comprehensive system in `app/services/reliability.py` for evaluating Grailed seller reliability 
- **Profile processing**: Functions to extract seller profile URLs and fetch seller data from their profile pages
- **Shipping estimation**: `app/services/shipping.py` calculates delivery costs to Russia based on item title categorization and Shopfans Lite pricing
- **Link resolution**: Handles Grailed app.link shorteners by following redirects
- **Concurrent processing**: Uses `asyncio.gather()` to scrape multiple URLs in parallel when multiple links are detected
- **HTTP session**: Configured with retries and proper user agent for reliable scraping
- **Currency conversion**: `app/services/currency.py` fetches USD to RUB exchange rate from Central Bank of Russia XML API with 5% markup
- **Admin notifications**: Sends Telegram alerts to admin when CBR API fails
- **Tiered pricing logic**: 
  - Items < $150 (including US shipping): Fixed $15 commission
  - Items ‚â• $150 (including US shipping): 10% of (item price + US shipping)
  - **Commission calculation**: Based on item price + US shipping costs (both values from listing)
  - **Updated logic (June 2025)**: Commission now includes US shipping in calculation base for fairer pricing
  - **Example**: $120 item + $40 US shipping = $160 base, 10% commission = $16 (was $15 fixed)
- **Russian Customs Duty (December 2025)**: 
  - **Threshold**: 200 EUR for personal imports
  - **Rate**: 15% of amount exceeding 200 EUR threshold
  - **Calculation base**: Item price + US shipping costs (same as commission base)
  - **Currency conversion**: EUR/USD rate from Central Bank of Russia XML API
  - **Example**: $250 item + $20 shipping = $270 (~240‚Ç¨), duty = 15% √ó (240‚Ç¨ - 200‚Ç¨) = 15% √ó 40‚Ç¨ ‚âà $6.75
- **Seller reliability scoring**: 4-criteria evaluation system (activity, rating, review volume, trusted badge) with Diamond/Gold/Silver/Bronze/Ghost categories

### Environment Variables

- `BOT_TOKEN`: Required Telegram bot token
- `PORT`: Server port (defaults to 8000)
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` or `RAILWAY_URL`: Used to determine webhook mode vs polling mode

### Currency Exchange Rate Sources

The bot uses the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) official XML API for all currency conversions:

**USD to RUB (for final price conversion):**
- **Endpoint**: `https://www.cbr.ru/scripts/XML_daily.asp`
- **Format**: XML with daily official rates
- **Processing**: Parses XML using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, finds USD entry, applies 5% markup
- **Markup justification**: 5% covers currency exchange fees and market volatility

**EUR to USD (for customs duty threshold):**
- **Endpoint**: Same CBR XML API
- **Calculation**: Cross-rate EUR/USD = EUR/RUB √∑ USD/RUB
- **Purpose**: Convert 200 EUR customs threshold to USD for duty calculation
- **No markup**: Cross-rate used as-is for threshold conversion

**Common features:**
- **Error handling**: No fallback sources - if CBR API is unavailable, affected features are disabled and admin is notified
- **Admin notifications**: Telegram message sent to admin (ID: 26917201) when CBR API fails
- **Caching**: Exchange rates cached for 1 hour for performance optimization

### Grailed Seller Reliability System

The bot implements a comprehensive seller evaluation system for Grailed with sophisticated scoring algorithms:

#### Scoring Criteria (Total: 100 points)

**Activity Score (0-30 points)**: Based on days since last listing update
- **Today (0 days)**: 30 points - Maximum activity score
- **Yesterday (1 day)**: 30 points - Still considered very active
- **2-7 days ago**: 24 points - Recent activity, good score
- **8-30 days ago**: 12 points - Moderate activity, some concern
- **>30 days ago**: 0 points - Inactive seller, triggers Ghost category

**Rating Score (0-35 points)**: Based on average seller rating (0.00-5.00)
- **4.8-5.0 stars**: 35 points - Excellent rating, maximum score
- **4.5-4.7 stars**: 28 points - Very good rating
- **4.0-4.4 stars**: 21 points - Good rating, acceptable
- **3.5-3.9 stars**: 14 points - Average rating, some risk
- **3.0-3.4 stars**: 7 points - Below average, higher risk
- **<3.0 stars**: 0 points - Poor rating, significant risk

**Review Volume Score (0-25 points)**: Based on number of completed transactions
- **500+ reviews**: 25 points - Very established seller
- **100-499 reviews**: 20 points - Well-established seller
- **50-99 reviews**: 15 points - Moderately experienced
- **20-49 reviews**: 10 points - Some experience
- **10-19 reviews**: 5 points - Limited experience
- **<10 reviews**: 0 points - New or inactive seller

**Badge Score (0-10 points)**: Trusted Seller badge status
- **Trusted Badge Present**: 10 points - Grailed-verified seller
- **No Badge**: 0 points - Standard seller account

#### Implementation Details
- **Profile fetching**: Functions in `app/scrapers/grailed.py` get seller profile URL from listing page
- **Data extraction**: **Headless browser only** - static HTML parsing doesn't work due to React SPA architecture
- **Playwright integration**: Uses headless Chromium to execute JavaScript and access dynamically loaded content
- **Evaluation**: `app/services/reliability.py` applies business rules to calculate scores and categories
- **Response formatting**: Creates user-friendly Russian messages via `app/bot/messages.py`
- **Configuration**: Can be enabled/disabled via `ENABLE_HEADLESS_BROWSER` environment variable

**‚ÑπÔ∏è No Data**: When seller information is unavailable
- Cause: Grailed's React SPA architecture or headless browser disabled
- Risk Level: Unknown - Unable to assess seller reliability
- Recommendation: Use listing URLs instead of profile URLs for better data extraction

#### User Interface
- **Listing analysis**: Seller reliability shown for buyable Grailed items (when data available)
- **Direct profile analysis**: **Limited functionality** - Users informed about technical limitations and encouraged to share listing URLs instead
- **Russian language**: All user messages in simple, neutral Russian with honest explanations of constraints

### Bot Behavior

#### URL Processing
1. **Profile URLs**: Functions in `app/bot/utils.py` detect Grailed seller profiles and process them accordingly
2. **Listing URLs**: Regular price calculation with optional seller reliability for Grailed buyable items
3. **Buyability detection**: Grailed items analyzed for buy-now vs offer-only status using JSON parsing

#### Message Types
- **Buyable items**: Item title with hyperlink + price calculation + seller reliability (for Grailed, when data available)
- **Offer-only items**: Message explaining need to contact seller + displayed price for reference
- **Profile analysis**: Full seller reliability analysis using headless browser extraction
- **Errors**: Simple Russian error messages with context about technical limitations

#### Message Formatting (Updated December 2025)
- **Item title display**: Added product name with clickable hyperlink to original listing page
- **Clean design**: Removed excessive emoji usage for better readability
- **Emoji positioning**: Moved emoji from headers to inline with category names
- **Seller info format**: "–ü—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤–µ—Ü: üíé Diamond (95/100)" instead of "üíé –ü—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤–µ—Ü: Diamond (95/100)"
- **Badge display**: Simplified to "–ü—Ä–æ–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤–µ—Ü" / "–ù–µ—Ç –±–µ–π–¥–∂–∞" without checkmark/cross emoji
- **Header cleanup**: "–ê–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤—Ü–∞ Grailed" without leading emoji

### Enhanced Price Display Format (Updated December 2025)
**Implemented structured multi-line format with Russian customs duty integration and item title display:**

**Current format with item title and customs duty:**

- **Customs duty calculation**: Automatically applied when item + US shipping > 200‚Ç¨
- **Commission clarity**: Shows calculation base ("10% –æ—Ç —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∞+–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∞ –°–®–ê")
- **Visual separation**: Clear separators between calculation stages
- **Smart display**: Customs duty line only appears when applicable
- **Multi-scenario support**: Handles all combinations of US/RU shipping and customs duty
- **Backward compatibility**: Title display is optional - falls back gracefully when title unavailable

### Shopfans Shipping Estimation (Updated December 2025)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Shipping weight estimates in `app/services/shipping.py` should be reviewed and updated quarterly based on actual shipment tracking data to maintain accuracy.

**Tiered Shipping System Based on Order Value:**

The shipping estimation system now uses dynamic pricing based on total order value (item price + US shipping):

**Route Selection:**
- **< $200**: Europe route (30.86$/kg) - Standard shipping via European logistics
- **‚â• $200**: Turkey route (35.27$/kg) - Enhanced routing via Turkey for medium-value orders  
- **‚â• $1000**: Kazakhstan route (41.89$/kg) - Premium logistics via Kazakhstan for high-value orders

**Handling Fee Structure:**
- **‚â§ 1.36kg (3 pounds)**: $3 handling fee - Light items warehouse processing
- **> 1.36kg (3 pounds)**: $5 handling fee - Heavy items additional handling

**Calculation Formula:**
```
shipping_cost = max($13.99, route_rate √ó weight_kg) + handling_fee
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses regex pattern matching on item titles to determine product categories
- Maps categories to estimated weights in kilograms from `app/config/shipping_table.yml`
- Route selection automatically determined by total order value (item + US shipping)
- Weight threshold updated from 0.45kg to 1.36kg (3 pounds) for more accurate handling fees
- Default weight: 0.60kg for unmatched items

**Example Calculations:**
- $150 order, 0.6kg: max($13.99, 30.86 √ó 0.6) + $3 = $21.52
- $250 order, 0.6kg: max($13.99, 35.27 √ó 0.6) + $3 = $24.16  
- $1200 order, 0.6kg: max($13.99, 41.89 √ó 0.6) + $3 = $28.13
